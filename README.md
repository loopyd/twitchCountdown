# Twitch Countdown Timer
A very simple countdown timer to be used as a browser source

## Usage

May add custom commands/interface in the future but for now the style sheet contains all the colour editing in RGBA format (standard CSS) and changing the values of the following:

    var initialDate
    var countDownDate

## "Installation"

You don't really install this, just download the ZIP (got to the green code button at top of page), place where convenient and add as a browser source in OBS/SLOBS/etc..
